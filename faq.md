**Q: What is this tutorial about?**

This tutorial is about how to use the scikit-learn API to do machine learning in Python.

**Q: What is this tutorial not about?**

This tutorial will not cover:

1. How particular ML algorithms work.
1. The basics of Python
1. How to setup your environment (this should have been done by contacting the instructor before class).

**Q: What preparation should I have before coming to the workshop?**

In terms of background knowledge, you should be:

1. Familiar with Python syntax, or at least capable of reading it. Familiarity with other scripting language's syntax is acceptable as well.
1. Familiar with object-oriented programming. A toy test: Implement a `Watch` object that has a method `current_time`, which does not accept any parameters, that tells the current time.
1. Able to read API documentation to debug and figure out how to code things.

In terms of computing environment, you should follow the instructions on the [README.md][1] file.
