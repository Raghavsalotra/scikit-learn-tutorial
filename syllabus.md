# Tutorial Syllabus:

1. Why Machine Learning?
    - High dimensional data
    - Large numbers of rows
    - Complex relationship between predictor and dependent variables.
2. Machine learning problem types
    - Supervised Learning - making predictions
        - Classification - predicting a label
        - Regression - predicting a continuous number
    - Unsupervised Learning - finding things that are similar to one another
    - scikit-learn flowchart
3. Unsupervised Learning API
    - Example problems & Hands-on
4. Supervised Learning API
    - Label prediction on influenza sequences
    - Prediction of HIV drug resistance
    - Hands-on
5. Statistical and computing practices
    - Cross-validation: train/test split
    - Permutation null models.
    - Parallelization on a single computer using built-in joblib
    - Hands-on
6 (time permitting) Overview of neural network & deep learning libraries: Keras, Theano, TensorFlow.
